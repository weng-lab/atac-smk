Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however important for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

Reasons:
    (check individual jobs above for details)
    input files updated by another job:
        all, bedgraphtobigwig, chrombpnet_bias, chrombpnet_prep_nonpeaks, frip_all, macs3_fold_change_signal, macs3_pvalue_signal, multiqc, overlap_peaks_jill
    output files have to be generated:
        bedgraphtobigwig, chrombpnet_bias, chrombpnet_prep_nonpeaks, frip_all, idr, macs3_callpeak, macs3_fold_change_signal, macs3_pvalue_signal, macs3_signal, multiqc, overlap_peaks, overlap_peaks_jill
    set of input files has changed since last execution:
        frip_all, multiqc, overlap_peaks_jill
Some jobs were triggered by provenance information, see 'reason' section in the rule displays above.
If you prefer that only modification time is used to determine whether a job shall be executed, use the command line option '--rerun-triggers mtime' (also see --help).
If you are sure that a change for a certain output file (say, <outfile>) won't change the result (e.g. because you just changed the formatting of a script or environment definition), you can also wipe its metadata to skip such a trigger via 'snakemake --cleanup-metadata <outfile>'. 
Rules with provenance triggered jobs: frip_all multiqc overlap_peaks_jill

This was a dry-run (flag -n). The order of jobs does not reflect the order of execution.
